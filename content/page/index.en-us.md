# Gitea - Git with a cup of tea

Gitea is a community managed [fork](https://blog.gitea.io/2016/12/welcome-to-gitea/) of [Gogs](http://gogs.io), lightweight code hosting solution written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and published under the [MIT](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/LICENSE) license. The code of Gitea is currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/go-gitea/).

At the time of writing, there are no official Gitea release yet, but we're working hard to get to 1.0.0 in a way that would allow seamless upgrades of existing Gogs deploys.
