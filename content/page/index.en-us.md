# Gitea - Git with a cup of tea

Gitea is a community managed fork of [Gogs](http://gogs.io), lightweight code hosting solution written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and published under the [MIT](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/LICENSE) license.

You can [try it online](https://try.gitea.io/) to get a feel of what it can do for you.

The code of Gitea is currently hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/go-gitea/)but we plan to self-host it as soon as possible.

At the time of writing, there are no official Gitea release yet, but we're working hard to get to 1.0.0 in a way that would allow seamless upgrades of existing Gogs deploys; keep an eye on the [download](https://dl.gitea.io) section
